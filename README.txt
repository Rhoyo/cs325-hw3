	Comments:
		I am not sure about Test Case 3, all of my other values are perfect.
		It is the only case that deviates from the example result.txt
		It also seems to me that my member 3 in case 3 is not wrong to pick the
		fourth item and the third item. Adding items 1-3 will only yield 6 with weight 3.
		Using items 3-4 results yields 7 with weight of 3. Perhaps I had a typo in my shopping.txt
		or I am indeed wrong.
